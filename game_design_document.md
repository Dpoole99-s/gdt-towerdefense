# Multiplayer Tower Defense Game - Game Design Document

## üéÆ Game Overview
- **Game Title:** [Your game title here]
- **Game Genre:** Sci-Fi Cybersecurity Tower Defense
- **Target Audience:** [Who is this game for? Age range? Gaming experience level?]
- **Game Summary:** A multiplayer tower defense game set inside a computer's circuit board, where players collaborate to defend against waves of malware, viruses, and cyber threats. Players build defensive programs and security measures to protect the system's core while managing computing resources and coordinating their defense strategy.

## üéØ Core Game Mechanics

### Tower Defense Elements
- What types of towers (security programs) can players build?
  - Example: _Firewall Tower - Creates a defensive barrier that slows enemy malware_
  - Example: _Antivirus Scanner - Medium range, deals damage over time to viruses_
  - Example: _Encryption Node - Protects nearby towers from being corrupted_
  - [Add more security program types...]

- What resources do players manage?
  - Example: _Processing Power (main currency for building)_
  - Example: _Memory (special resource for upgrades)_
  - Example: _Bandwidth (affects tower operation speed)_
  - [List other computing resources...]

### Multiplayer Features
- How many players can protect the system simultaneously?
- How do players coordinate their defense? (Share resources? Specialize in different security types?)
- What makes the multiplayer experience unique?

### Enemy Types & AI
- List planned cyber threats and their behaviors:

Example enemies:
```
Virus Worm
- Replicates itself if not destroyed quickly
- Uses branching paths to spread through the circuit board

Data Corruptor
- Disables towers temporarily
- Targets critical system nodes

DDoS Swarm
- Large groups of weak units that overwhelm defenses
- Split into multiple paths to distribute the attack
```

## üé® Visual Style & UI

### Art Style
- Neon-lit circuit board paths that enemies follow
- Sleek, holographic security program towers
- Cyber-themed visual effects (digital particles, matrix-style code effects)
- Reference images: [Insert placeholder images for circuit boards, cyberpunk UI, digital effects]

### User Interface
```
[Sketch rough UI layout here]
Theme: Holographic cyber security dashboard
Elements to include:
- System resource monitors (CPU, Memory, Bandwidth)
- Security program selection grid
- Network status (other players' connections)
- System integrity indicators (health)
- Circuit board map with threat detection overlay
```

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Networking Requirements
- How will multiplayer synchronization work?
- What data needs to be shared between players?
- How will you handle:
  - Player connections/disconnections?
  - Game state synchronization?
  - Latency issues?

### AI Implementation
- How will enemy pathfinding work?
- What factors will influence enemy decisions?
  - Example: _Avoiding heavily defended areas_
  - Example: _Targeting weakest defenses_

## üìà Game Progression

### Levels/Waves
- How do threat levels escalate?
  - Example: Wave 1 - Basic malware
  - Example: Wave 5 - Coordinated virus attacks
  - Example: Wave 10 - Advanced ransomware breach
- How does system vulnerability increase over time?

### Player Advancement
- What security upgrades can players research?
- How are threat detection scores calculated?
- What achievements can players unlock?
  - Example: "Zero Day Defense" - Stop a wave without losing health
  - Example: "Network Administrator" - Successfully link defenses with all players

- What types of sound effects are needed?
  - Digital processing sounds
  - Alert systems
  - Cyber attack impacts
- What style of background music?
  - Electronic/Synthwave soundtrack
  - Dynamic intensity based on threat levels
- List key sound events:
  - Security program activation
  - Malware destruction
  - System alerts
  - Resource collection
  - Network connectivity sounds
